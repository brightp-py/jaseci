# How things went

Overall, I'm enjoying this process for programming! I like graphs, and how 
different aspects of some system all relate to each other, so I appreciate 
jaseci's architecture. I'm still learning some of the quirks, but everything 
makes sense so far.

I did run into an issue when using the `use.qa_classify;` action, but I went 
to Piazza and added the line

```
can use.qa_classify;
```

and everything works now!

The bible was very informative on how to install everything needed for this 
walkthrough. I liked the chill, conversation vibe it had at times, good fun. 
There were quite a few typos, though. Maybe I'll practice my forking skills
by going through the original latex file for that document.
